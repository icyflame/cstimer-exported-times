# csTimer exported times

A bash script to copy all the cstimer exports from the `Downloads` folder,
timestamp them and put them into this repository, and commit to this repository.

**TODO:** Run `git push` only if the credential cache has active credentials.

If that can be done, then I can put the `git push` in a cron job, and have a
completely automated system! :smile:
